 *   vars override even those.)
 * - **Mechanics** — the directives that make delegation and tools work at all.

/**
 * The opening curriculum. The whole plan is stated ONCE, in the startup
 * instructions (LESSON_DIRECTIVE below) — the model owns the pacing from
 * there. It used to be prompted one word at a time with mid-session appends,
 * and that broke the conversation cycle: an append lands as new context the
 * model acts on immediately, so "say it again: Hello" became "Now, goodbye"
 * in the same breath, the practice loop cut off mid-word.
 *
 * The card data is here because the SERVER pushes each term card when the
 * tutor is heard saying the word (session.ts) — the model is never asked to
 * delegate for words we already hold. Measured, not assumed: a full session
 * of "delegate this teaching" prompts closed with `backend_model_usage: []`.
 * GPT-Live's delegation is trained for capability gaps (current information,
 * deep reasoning), and teaching "hello" is within its own ability, so it
 * answers directly no matter what the prose says.
